\section*{Abstract}
In Shkoder there are a lot of companies that are not very familiar with new
technologies. They do all the work manually. Nowadays, however, this work is mostly
done by computers and new technologies. We offer these companies IT-support to
make their work easier and safer. Riad, one of our colleagues, informed us that
Skoda needs IT support. That's why we came up with the idea to do our thesis based
on a partnership with this company. Through an analysis that we carried out, we
realized that the company needs a network, an inventory program, a balancing
program and a website. In a meeting with the owner of Skoda we discussed about
the opportunity to cooperate with him. As we presented our idea to him, he realized
the possibility of improving procedures in his company and that he should take our
help in consideration.
